May I know who’s calling? Oh! This is Ram, his colleague from the office. I need to inform him about an urgent meeting. Do you know when he’ll be back? He just went for a morning walk. He should be back soon. Would you like me to pass a message? Yes, please. Let him know that he has to be at the office half an hour earlier today for an urgent meeting before the regular one. It’s important that he doesn’t miss it. Now, I’ll call my mom’s number, which is with him, and inform him about it. Anything else? No, that’s all. Thanks for your help. You’re welcome. Have a nice day!",
